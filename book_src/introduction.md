# Introduction

Welcome to _GBA From Scratch With Rust_.

It's a book about programming for the Game Boy Advance using the Rust programming langauge.
Particularly, everything will be as "from scratch" as possible.
This means that we'll use the `core` part of the standard library,
but for all other code it'll be stuff we've covered how to make in the book.

If you want to write 20 lines of code to call a few library functions and have a working Pong clone, this book is **NOT** for you.
This is *not* the quick path to having a completed game.
This is the much slower path of learning how all the things are happening under the hood.
If that kind of thing sounds like fun, then this book is probably for you.

Doing things from scratch is *not* a time-efficient way to complete a project,
but it is a pretty good way to learn about all the layers that go into something.

## Expected Background

The primary expected background for reading is book is a basic understanding of the Rust language itself.
You'll also need to be familiar with using `cargo` based projects, which most every Rust programmer already is.
The usual way to learn Rust is by reading [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/),
but any similar introduction to the language should suffice.

We will definitely be using many advanced features of Rust to get things done,
but those parts I will explain as we go.
